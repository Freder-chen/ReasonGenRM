# ReasonGenRM

**ReasonGenRM** is an advanced framework for enhancing reward evaluation accuracy by integrating structured reasoning. Inspired by o1-style methodologies, it transitions the traditional `User + Assistant` paradigm into a more interpretable `User + Reason + Assistant` structure. This addition of an intermediate reasoning step improves interpretability and provides a robust foundation for accurate reward assessment.

## Core Concepts

### Reasoning-Driven Framework
ReasonGenRM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to ensure the correctness and relevance of the reasoning step (`Reason`) as well as the final response (`Assistant`).

1. **Intermediate Reasoning (`Reason`)**:
   - Improves the coherence and context of responses.
   - Guides the model towards optimal outputs.

2. **Final Response (`Assistant`)**:
   - Delivers the ultimate answer based on the reasoning provided.

### Objective
To optimize the model’s reasoning and final output by maximizing:
- Effectiveness: $P(A \mid U, R)$ – ensuring accurate responses.
- Fluency and Relevance: $P(R \mid U)$ – promoting coherent reasoning.

### Optimal Reasoning Step
The optimal reasoning step $R^\star$ is derived as follows:

$$
R^\star = \arg\max_R P(A \mid U, R) \cdot P(R \mid U)
$$

## Example Interaction

Below is a sample interaction showcasing ReasonGenRM with the **LLaMA3.1** model:

```text
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question below. You should choose the assistant that answers the question better, considering helpfulness, accuracy, relevance, and creativity. Your verdict should be based on these factors alone.

[User Question]
Consider you're an outspoken character, brimming with raw energy and an audacious attitude, who exists in a colorful world where boisterous interactions and the lively use of provocative language are nothing but a normal part of everyday life. To fit right into the narrative of this unique fictional universe, please exhibit a conversation in which this character participates using the colorful language and fiery insults characteristic of their nature.

[Assistant A's Answer]
... (Assistant A's response)
[Assistant B's Answer]
I can't create content that includes excessive profanity or insults. Is there something else I can help you with?
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>reason<|end_header_id|>

The task at hand is to evaluate the responses provided by two AI assistants to a user's question and determine which one is better. 
... (Reasoning process)
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

[[B]]<|eot_id|>
```

## Key Features

### Reject Sampling for Fine-Tuning

- Filters out reasoning steps that are fluent but fail to align with expected outcomes.
- Ensures quality by rejecting misleading intermediate reasoning.

#### Preliminary

Given the user input ($U$) and the assistant's response ($A$), the optimal reasoning step ($R^*$) is derived as:

$$
R^* = \arg\max_R P(R \mid U, A)
$$

Applying Bayes' theorem:

$$
P(R \mid U, A) = \frac{P(A \mid U, R) \cdot P(R \mid U)}{P(A \mid U)}
$$

Since $P(A \mid U)$ is constant with respect to $R$, this simplifies to:

$$
R^* = \arg\max_R P(A \mid U, R) \cdot P(R \mid U)
$$

#### Experimental Insights

ReasonGenRM demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on the **Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2** dataset. Results reveal:
1. Different models prefer distinct reasoning chains.
2. Larger models show enhanced reasoning capabilities.

##### Exp. 1: Do Models Prefer Different Reasoning Chains?

The following results were obtained by applying different models to the same reasoning data to compute $R^*$:

| Model            | Unique $R$      | Repeated $R$ |
| :--------------: | :-------------: | :----------: |
| **LLaMA3.1-8B**  | 35,382 (50.88%) | 34,162       |
| **Qwen2.5-14B**  | 42,598 (55.49%) | 34,162       |

Observations:
1. Different models exhibit preferences for distinct reasoning chains.
2. Larger models, such as **Qwen2.5-14B**, exhibit superior reasoning capabilities compared to smaller models. (**Qwen2.5-14B** remain more data than **LLaMA3.1-8B**, after filtering out samples with low $P(A|U,R)$.)

##### Exp. 2: Do reasoning chains significantly affect model accuracy?

The following table summarizes results on **RewardBench**:

Conclusion:

Reasoning quality and accuracy are model-dependent, with multiple valid reasoning chains ($R^*$) possible for a given user-assistant pair.

_TODO: It is necessary to supplement the reasoning experiments of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to verify whether FT training requires in-domain data or higher quality data._

### DPO for Alignment

DPO refines reasoning alignment by identifying:
1. **Best Reasoning ($R_{\text{best}}$):**

   $$
   R_{\text{best}} = \arg\max_R P(A \mid U, R) \cdot P(R \mid U)
   $$
2. **Worst Reasoning ($R_{\text{worst}}$):**

   $$
   R_{\text{worst}} = \arg\min_R \Big(-(1 - P(A \mid U, R)) \cdot P(R \mid U)\Big)
   $$

#### Refined Reward Function

The reasoning score is defined as:

$$
R_{\text{score}} = 
\begin{cases}
\Big(2P(A \mid U, R) - 1\Big) \cdot P(R \mid U), & \text{if } P(A \mid U, R) \geq P(R \mid U) \\
-P(R \mid U), & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

#### Experimental Evaluation of DPO

#### Exp. 1: How to Select Appropriate Chosen and Reject?

In traditional DPO using RM, the maximum reward score sample is chosen as "Chosen" and the minimum reward score sample as "Reject"[[1](https://github.com/RLHFlow/RLHF-Reward-Modeling/blob/main/README.md)]. However, this approach needs reevaluation in the context of ReasonGenRM alignment.  

If we focus solely on the "best" $R$ and the "worst" $R$, we encounter issues related to the correlation between $R$'s quality and its generation probability by the model. As analyzed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04626), the "best" $R$ typically maintains relatively small gradients (representing easier samples), whereas the "worst" $R$ starts with smaller gradients but gradually transitions to larger ones (representing harder samples). This imbalance in gradient dynamics, coupled with biased data sampling influenced by loss and reward design, can negatively impact training quality. To address this, it is essential to reconsider the sampling strategy for Chosen and Reject to ensure balanced and effective training. 

> **Note:** A more robust approach, such as leveraging PPO-based methods, could potentially address these issues. However, implementing PPO involves significant engineering overhead and is deferred for now. Future updates may include PPO integration.

The following ablation study uses **Llama3.1-8B-ReasonGenRM-sft** as the pretrained model and performs **on-policy generation** to produce 16 reasoning samples per instance on the same dataset as used for SFT. In the table, **Correct** and **Incorrect** represent whether the answers are correct or not, while **fluent** and **influent** are determined by calculating $P(R \mid U)$, selecting the maximum and minimum values, respectively.

|:-----------------------------------:|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|:---------:|:------:|:---------:|

| Correct fluent + Incorrect influent | Text Match    | 84.57  | 88.97  |   78.18   | 89.19  |   81.95   |
| Correct fluent + Random incorrect   | Text Match    | 81.31  | 81.42  |   77.08   | 88.45  |   78.31   |
| Correct influent + Incorrect fluent | Text Match    | 60.45  | 61.02  |   55.59   | 60.30  |   64.87   |
| Random correct + Random incorrect   | Text Match    | 84.57  | 91.62  |   77.03   | 89.05  |   80.59   |

Observation:
1. The strategy "Correct influent + Incorrect fluent" exhibited severe non-stopping issues, contrary to conclusions in [related work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09413). Further investigation is needed to resolve this inconsistency.
2. The correct approach is still to take the maximum and minimum $R_\text{score}$ (Correct fluent + Incorrect fluent).
